## About Executive for ExpressionEngine

Executive provides a command line interface into ExpressionEngine. You can run commands as you're developing, log in to your server via SSH and run commands, run commands on deploy, schedule commands to run at certain intervals, and more.

Executive also provides an interface for you to create custom commands and schedules per-site, and an interface for developers to provide commands from their add-ons.
