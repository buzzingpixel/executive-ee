## Executive 2.x requires EE 4

Because of the changes required to the ChannelDesigner class that were backwards incompatible with EE 3, Executive has been updated to 2.x and requires EE 4.

## About Executive for ExpressionEngine

Executive provides a command line interface into ExpressionEngine, custom migrations, custom class auto-loading, developer defined extensions per/project, developer template tags per/project, and custom control panel sections per/project. You can run commands as you're developing, log in to your server via SSH and run commands, run commands on deploy, schedule commands to run at certain intervals, and more.

Executive also provides an interface for you to create custom commands and schedules per-site, and an interface for developers to provide commands from their add-ons.
